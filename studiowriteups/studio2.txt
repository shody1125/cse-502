Below each question, type in your short, to-the-point answers.

Part A

What do you see in the plots for ticks and time?

>the curve is like a exponential growth.

How would you characterize those curves?

>the curve is O(x^2) since it's a Equal difference sequence summation problem.

Based on the current code for addLast, why do you see this behavior?

because everytime we add an element to the end of the list, we need to go over first n elements, so the ticker we use is N+1, and then N+2....for equal difference summation, the result is a exponential grow result

Part B

What behavior do you see now for appending n items to a list if you use a tail reference?
>linear
While we have reasoned so far only about time, if we are adding n elements to the end of a list, what is the asymptotic complexity of the additional space required when using the tail reference?
2n
Under what conditions would you recommend using a linked list with a tail reference vs. a linked list without at tail reference?
<the size of the list is less than the operation times for haveing a tail element.
Part C

Why does getSize() take the time it does?
it counts N+1 times
How did you achieve Î˜(1) performance for getSize()?
announce a new element for count;
